## Maze Runner


### Description:

Maze Runner is a Python-based maze game where the player navigates through a maze to collect diamonds while avoiding AI-controlled zombies. The game features various characters and elements, including the player, zombies, diamonds, and grass bushes.


### Characters and Elements:

1. **Player**: The main character controlled by the player. The player's objective is to collect diamonds scattered throughout the maze while avoiding zombies. The player's movement is controlled using arrow keys.

2. **Zombies**: AI-controlled enemies that move around the maze. Zombies aim to catch the player and end the game if they make contact. The movement of zombies is determined by an algorithm that tracks the player's position and adjusts the zombie's direction accordingly.

3. **Diamonds**: Collectible items placed at different locations within the maze. The player gains points by collecting diamonds. Once all diamonds are collected, the player wins the game.

4. **Grass Bushes**: Decorative elements used to design the maze environment. These bushes create barriers and add complexity to the maze layout.


### Game Environment:

The game environment consists of a maze created using a grid-based system. The maze layout is defined using characters in a text-based format. Each character represents a specific element, such as walls, player spawn points, treasure locations, and enemy spawn points. Grass bushes are represented by characters in the maze.


### Algorithms:

1. **Player Movement**: The player's movement is controlled by functions that handle arrow key inputs. These functions check for collisions with walls and other obstacles to ensure valid movement.

2. **Zombie Tracking**: Zombies use a tracking algorithm to follow the player's movements. Based on the player's position relative to the zombie, the algorithm determines the optimal direction for the zombie to move towards the player.


### Artificial Intelligence:

The incorporation of AI in the game is evident in the behavior of the zombies. Instead of following predefined paths, zombies dynamically adjust their movement based on the player's actions. This adds a layer of challenge and unpredictability to the gameplay, as zombies actively pursue the player.


### Future Scope:

1. **Additional Mazes**: Introduce more maze layouts with varying complexities to enhance gameplay diversity.

2. **Randomized Diamond Placement**: Implement randomization algorithms to scatter diamonds across the maze differently in each playthrough, increasing replay value.

3. **AI Bot**: Develop an AI bot capable of playing the game autonomously. This could involve using pathfinding algorithms to navigate the maze efficiently and evade zombies while collecting diamonds.
